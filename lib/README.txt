Archived Twitter data was captured using twarc, a Python library developed by Ed Summers that uses the Twitter API to archive Twitter JSON data. For more information on twarc, visit the project's GitHub page: https://github.com/edsu/twarc

The raw data captured by twarc can be found in the 'json' directory. The JSON files were converted to HTML pages for ease of use; converted pages can be found in the 'html' directory. A good starting point for using this collection of archived Twitter data is the index.html file, located in the collection's root directory, which contains a table of HTML and JSON files for each capture date represented in this collection.

Twitter user profile images and tweeted images were downloaded for long-term preservation and use and can be found in the 'media' directory. URLs in the converted HTML documents were updated to point to the downloaded content. A spreadsheet containing original image URLs and download locations can be found in the 'media' directory.
